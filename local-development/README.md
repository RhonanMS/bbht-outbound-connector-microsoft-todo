# Local test environment

The files provided in this directory allow the start of a local Camunda 8 environment
and deployment as well as execution of a test process for the Microsoft To Do Connector.

## Necessary tools

The following is required for execution:
* a current [Podman](https://podman.io/) or [./docker](https://www../docker.com/) virtualization environment and
* the [Camunda Desktop Modeler](https://camunda.com/de/download/modeler/) in a version that supports Camunda 8.5

## Configuration of the connector secrets

**ATTENTION: The file `connector-secrets.txt` must not be committed under any circumstances. üî•**
To configure the connector secrets, the file
`connector-secrets.txt` must be created manually with the following content
must be created manually with the following content.

```
# add secrets per line in the format NAME=VALUE
# WARNING: ensure not to commit changes to this file
TENANT_ID=
CLIENT_ID=
CLIENT_SECRET=
```

The three fields must then be filled with the correct values for the
Microsoft 365 tenant.

## Configuration of the local environment

To be able to use the BBHT Connector, the project must first be built (e.g. using `mvn clean verify`).
Then copy the file `${project.dir}/target/bbht-outbound-connector-microsoft-todo-${version}-with-dependencies.jar` into the directory
`local-test` directory.
In order for the connector to be used in the Camunda Desktop Modeler, the file
`$[project.dir}/element-templates/connector-for-microsoft-to-do.json` for use in process models
must be copied.
Under Windows, the file must be copied to the directory `${modeler.basedir}/resources/element-templates`; under
MacOS to the directory `${user.home}/.camunda/element-templates`.

## Starting the Camunda engine

‚ö†Ô∏è Execute the following commands in the `local-test` subdirectory.‚ö†Ô∏è

### Podman

To run via Podman, execute the following command:

```shell
podman compose --env-file ./docker-compose.env -f ./docker-compose.yaml up
```

On MacOS there may be problems with the start, then execute the following command instead:

```shell
./docker-compose --env-file ./docker-compose.env -f ./docker-compose.yaml --userns=keep-id:uid={$UID} up
```


### ./docker

The following command must be executed to run ./docker:

```shell
./docker-compose --env-file ./docker-compose.env -f ./docker-compose.yaml up
```

## Logins

The login data for local development is

* Username: `demo`
* Password: `demo`

### Camunda Operate

The local development instance of *Camunda Operate* can be accessed via the
URL [http://localhost:8081/](http://localhost:8081/).

### Camunda Tasklist

The local development instance of *Camunda Tasklist* can be accessed via the
URL [http://localhost:8082/](http://localhost:8082/).

### Zeebe Engine

The *Zeebe Engine* is available at [http://localhost:26500/](http://localhost:26500/).


## Deploy and execute the process

To deploy and execute the process, the file `local-test/connector-test.bpmn` must first be opened in the
Camunda Desktop Modeler must be opened.

![Camunda Desktop Modeler with Test Process](./doc/modeler.png)

The process must first be deployed in the Camunda engine. To do this, click on the rocket symbol at the bottom and
select the following options:

* `Deployment name`: `connector-test`
* `Target`: `Camunda 8 Self-Managed`
* `Cluster endpoint`: `http://localhost:26500`
* `Authentication`: `None`

Then start the deployment with ‚ÄúDeploy‚Äù. After a short time, the following message should appear

![Deployment Success message](./doc/deployment-success.png)

The process can now be started. To do this, click on the playback icon at the bottom and enter the following
Add the following variable definition:

```json
{ ‚Äúuserid‚Äù: ‚Äúemail@tenant.onmicrosoft.com‚Äù }
```

![Starting the Test Process](./doc/start.png)

Now execute the process via ‚ÄúStart‚Äù. This should also be acknowledged with a message:

![Process Start message](./doc/start-success.png)

Now log in to [Camunda Operate](http://localhost:8081) (login: `demo`/`demo`). Switch to the Process view
select the process ‚ÄúTest BBHT Connector for MS To Do‚Äù, enter ‚ÄúAll Version‚Äù for Versions
and click on all options (both `Running Instances` and `Finished Instances`) in the filters:

![Setting the Filters in Camunda Operate](./doc/operate-filters.png)

Then select a process and check whether it has run correctly
